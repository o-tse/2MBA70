\textbf{Problem 9.1}
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
\item We show that
\[
\|f\|_{p_\theta} \le \|f\|_{p_0}^{\,\theta} \, \|f\|_{p_1}^{\,1-\theta}.
\]
Set $A = |f|^{p_0}$, $B = |f|^{p_1}$ and choose
\[
\alpha := \frac{\theta p_\theta}{p_0}, \qquad \beta := \frac{(1-\theta)p_\theta}{p_1}.
\]
Then $\alpha p_0 = \theta p_\theta$, $\beta p_1 = (1-\theta)p_\theta$, and
\[
\alpha + \beta = p_\theta \left( \frac{\theta}{p_0} + \frac{1-\theta}{p_1} \right) = 1.
\]
Hence, by H\"older's inequality,
\[
	\int_\theta |f|^{p_\theta}\,d\mu = \int_\theta A^{\alpha} B^{\beta}\,d\mu
\le \left( \int_\theta A\,d\mu \right)^{\alpha} \left( \int_\theta B\,d\mu \right)^{\beta}
= \|f\|_{p_0}^{\,\theta p_\theta} \, \|f\|_{p_1}^{\,(1-\theta)p_\theta}.
\]
Taking $p_\theta$-th roots gives the desired inequality.

\item Given $p \in (p_0,p_1)$, define
\[
\theta = \frac{\frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{p_1}}{\frac{1}{p_0} - \frac{1}{p_1}} \in (0,1),
\]
so that $\frac{1}{p} = \frac{\theta}{p_0} + \frac{1-\theta}{p_1}$, i.e.\ $p = p_\theta$.
If $f \in L^{p_0} \cap L^{p_1}$, then by (a),
\[
\|f\|_p \le \|f\|_{p_0}^{\,\theta} \, \|f\|_{p_1}^{\,1-\theta} < +\infty,
\]
hence $f \in L^p(\mu)$ for all $p \in (p_0,p_1)$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Problem 9.2}
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
	\item If $X \in L^\infty(\mathbb P)$, then $X \in L^p(\mathbb P)$ for all $p \ge 1$.

Indeed, since
\[
|X|(\omega)^p \le \|X\|_\infty^{\,p} \quad \text{for $\mathbb{P}$-almost everywhere},
\]
we have that
\[
	\|X\|_p^p = \mathbb E|X|^p \le \|X\|_\infty^{\,p} \, \mathbb P(\mathcal{X}) 
= \|X\|_\infty^{\,p} < \infty.
\]
Thus $X \in L^p$ for every $p \ge 1$.

\item \emph{All moments finite.} Using the standard normal density 
$\varrho(x) = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2}$,
\[
\mathbb E|X|^p 
= 2 \int_0^\infty x^p \varrho(x)\,dx
= \frac{2^{p/2}}{\sqrt{\pi}}\, \Gamma\!\left(\frac{p+1}{2}\right) < \infty,
\]
so $X \in L^p$ for all $p \ge 1$.

\emph{Not essentially bounded.} For every $M>0$,
\[
\mathbb P(|X|>M) = 2 \int_M^\infty \varrho(x)\,dx > 0,
\]
so $\mathrm{ess\,sup}_{\omega\in\mathcal{X}}\,|X(\omega)| = +\infty$, i.e., $X \notin L^\infty(\mathbb P)$.
\end{enumerate}
