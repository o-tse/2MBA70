\textbf{Problem 8.6}
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
\item Define the sets
\[
	B_j := \bigcup_{i \ge j} A_i,\qquad j\in\bbN.
\]
Clearly the sequence $(B_j)_{j\in\bbN}$ is decreasing and $\{A_n \text{ i.o.}\}\subset B_j$ for every $j \in \mathbb{N}$. 

By assumption, and the $\sigma$-subadditivity of $\bbP$,
\[
\bbP(B_1) = \bbP\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i \right) \leq \sum_{i=1}^\infty \bbP(A_i) < +\infty.
\]
Moreover, the summability also gives
\[
	\lim_{j\to\infty}\bbP(B_j) \leq \limsup_{j\to\infty}\sum_{i=j}^\infty \bbP(A_i) = 0.
\]
Hence, by the continuity from above of $\mu$, we obtain
\[
	\bbP(\{A_n \text{ i.o.}\}) \le \bbP\left(\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty B_j\right) = \lim_{j\to \infty} \bbP(B_j) = 0,
\]
i.e., $\{A_n \text{ i.o.}\}$ is a null set. In other words, $\bbP$-almost every $\omega$ is in only finitely many $A_n$.
\item We will prove that 
\[
	\bbP(\Omega \setminus \{A_n \text{ i.o.}\}) = 0,
\]
from which the result follows since $\bbP(\Omega) = 1$.

First note that
\[
	\Omega \setminus \{A_n \text{ i.o.}\} = \bigcup_{k \ge 1} \left(\bigcup_{n \ge k} A_n\right)^c
	= \bigcup_{k \ge 1} \bigcap_{n \ge k} A_n^c.
\]

Next, since $A_n$ are independent, so are $A_n^c$. Thus, for any $k \ge 1$ we have that
\begin{align*}
	\bbP\left(\bigcap_{n \ge k} A_n^c\right) &= \prod_{n \ge k} \bbP(A_n^c) = \prod_{n \ge k} (1-\bbP(A_m)\\
	&\le \prod_{n \ge k} e^{-\bbP(A_n)} = e^{-\sum_{n \ge k} \bbP(A_n)} = 0.
\end{align*}
Here we used that for any $0 \le x \le 1$ it holds that $1-x \le e^{-x}$.

Finally, using $\sigma$-subadditivity we conclude that
\[
	\bbP(\Omega \setminus \{A_n \text{ i.o.}\}) = \bbP\left(\bigcup_{k \ge 1} \bigcap_{n \ge k} A_n^c\right)
	\le \sum_{k \ge 1} \bbP\left(\bigcap_{n \ge k} A_n^c\right) = 0.
\]
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Problem 8.8}

One direction is easy. Assume that $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent according to Definition 7.1.4. Now take any $a,b \in \bbR$ and note that $A_1 := X_1^{-1}((-\infty,a]) \in \sigma(X_1)$ and $A_2 := X_2^{-1}((-\infty, b]) \in \sigma(X_2)$. Then by the definition of independence we have that
\[
	\mathbb{P}(X_1 \le a, X_2 \le b) = \bbP(A_1 \cap A_2) = \bbP(A_1) \bbP(A_2) = \mathbb{P}(X_1 \le a) \mathbb{P}(X_2 \le b).
\]

So let us focus now on the other direction. Assume that for all $a,b \in \bbR$
\[
	\mathbb{P}(X_1 \le a, X_2 \le b) = \mathbb{P}(X_1 \le a) \mathbb{P}(X_2 \le b).
\]
We now have to show that $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent according to Definition 7.1.4.

First note that since the family $(-\infty, a] \times (-\infty ,b]$ generate the 2-dimensional Borel \sigalg/ we have, using Theorem 2.2.17, that
\[
	\bbP(X_1 \in B_1, X_2 \in B_2) = \bbP(X_1 \in B_1) \bbP(X_2 \in B_2)
\]
for all $B_1, B_2 \in \cB_{\bbR}$.

Now fix a set $B_2 \in \cB_{\bbR}$, set $A_2 := X_2^{-1}(B_2) \in \sigma(X_2)$, and define the following two measures on the space $(\Omega, \sigma(X_1))$
\[
	\mu_1(A) = \bbP(A \cap A_2) \quad \text{and} \quad \mu_2(A) = \bbP(A)\bbP(A_2).
\]  

Let $a \in \bbR$ and consider the set $A_1 := X_1^{-1}((-\infty ,a]) \in \sigma(X_1)$. Then, by our assumption we have that
\[
	\mu_1(A_1) = \bbP(A_1 \cap A_2) = \bbP(X_1 \le a, X_2 \in B_2) = \bbP(X_1 \le a) \bbP(X_2 \in B_2) = \bbP(A_1) \bbP(A_2)
	= \mu_2(A_1).
\]
In other words, the measures $\mu_1, \mu_2$ coincide on the set $\{X_1^{-1}((-\infty, a]) \, : \, a \in \bbR\}$.

Since the set $(-\infty,a]$ generate $\cB_{\bbR}$ it follows that 
\[
	\sigma(X_1) = \sigma(\{X_1^{-1}((-\infty, a]) \, : \, a \in \bbR\}).
\]
In addition, this set satisfies the conditions of Theorem 2.2.17 and hence we conclude that $\mu_1(A) = \mu_2(A)$ for all $A \in \sigma(X_1)$.

We can repeat this argument for the two measures on $(\Omega, \sigma(X_2))$
\[
	\nu_1(A) = \bbP(A_1 \cap A) \quad \text{ and } \quad \nu_2(A) = \bbP(A_1) \bbP(A), 
\]
where $A_1 \in \{X_1^{-1}((-\infty, a]) \, : \, a \in \bbR\}$ is fixed. 

From this we conclude that for any $A_1 \in \sigma(X_1)$ and $A_2 \in \sigma(X_2)$
\[
	\bbP(A_1 \cap A_2) = \bbP(A_1)\bbP(A_2)
\]
and hence $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent.

%
%Fix $\varepsilon > 0$ and define $A_n(\varepsilon) :\{|X_n - X| > \varepsilon\}$. Then the assumption translates to
%\[
%	\sum_{n \ge 1} \bbP(A_n(\varepsilon)) < \infty.
%\]
%By Lemma 8.11 1) this then implies that $\bbP(A_n(\varepsilon) \text{ i.o.}) = 0$. Since $\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, Lemma 8.9 now implies that $X_n \aslim X$.
