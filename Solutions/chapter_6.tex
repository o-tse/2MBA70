\textbf{Problem 6.4}
From Theorem~6.5.9, we find for any $\varepsilon>0$ a continuous and bounded function $g\in L^1(\Omega,\mu)$ such that
\[
	\|f-g\|_1 <\frac{\varepsilon}{2}.
\]
Let $M>0$ and set $g_M:= \varphi_M g$, where is a continuous function with compact support satisfying $0\le \varphi_M \le 1$, $\varphi_M\equiv 1$ on $\overline{B_M}$ and $\varphi_M\equiv 0$ on $B_{M+1}^c$. Notice that
	\begin{align*}
		\int_{\bbR^d} |g-g_M|\,\dd\mu = \int_{B_M^c} g\,\dd\mu \le \|g\|_{\sup}\,\mu(B_M^c).
	\end{align*}
Since $\mu$ is finite, the continuity from above of $\mu$ gives $\lim_{M\to\infty} \mu(B_{M}^c) = 0$. Hence, we find some $M=M_\varepsilon>0$ such that
\[
	\int_{\bbR^d} |g-g_M|\,\dd\mu < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}.
\]
Altogether, we've found some $g_M$ such that
\[
	\|f-g_M\|_1 \le \|f-g\|_1 + \|g-g_M\| < \varepsilon.
\]
