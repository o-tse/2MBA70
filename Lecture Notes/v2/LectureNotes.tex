%				[Lastname] instead of [van der].
%Usage:			Write \swap{Lastname}{~van~der~}, Firstname instead of [van der Lastname, Firstname] in the author header
%				of the bibtex entry.

\begin{chapquote}[30pt]{Emile Borel}
The occurrence of any event where the chances are beyond one in ten followed by 50 zeros is an event that we can state with certainty will never happen, no matter how much time is allotted and no matter how many conceivable opportunities could exist for the event to take place.

These are lecture notes for the course \emph{Measure and Probability Theory}. They are by no means a replacement for the lectures, instructions, and/or the books. Nor are they intended to cover every aspect of the field of measure theory or probability theory.

Since these are lecture notes, they also include problems. Each chapter ends with a set of exercises that are designed to help you understand the contents of the chapter better and master the tools and concepts.

These notes are still in progress and they almost surely contain small typos. If you see any or if you think that the presentation of some concepts is not yet crystal clear and might enjoy some polishing feel free to drop a line. The most efficient way is to send an email to us, \href{mailto:w.l.f.v.d.hoorn@tue.nl}{w.l.f.v.d.hoorn@tue.nl} or \href{mailto:o.t.c.tse@tue.nl}{o.t.c.tse@tue.nl}. Comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.
